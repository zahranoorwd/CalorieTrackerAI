    </p>

    <h2>3. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <div class="disclaimer">
      <p>
        THE APP DOES NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL ADVICE. The nutritional information, calorie estimates, educational content, and AI-generated food analysis provided by the App are for general informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as medical or dietary advice.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      AI-powered food scanning provides estimates only and may not be fully accurate. Always verify nutritional information from authoritative sources, especially if you have food allergies, dietary restrictions, or medical conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should consult a qualified healthcare provider, registered dietitian, or nutritionist before making significant changes to your diet, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions, are pregnant or nursing, or are under the age of 18.
    </p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>

    </p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
